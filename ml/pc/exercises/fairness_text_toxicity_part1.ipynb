        "Fairness Indicators makes it easy for you to ask questions about how your model performs for different groups of users. The suite includes [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started), [TensorFlow Model Analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/model_analysis/tfma_basic), and the [What-If tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/).\n",
        "\n",
        "These tools help you compute common classification fairness metrics and evaluate model performance for defined groups of users, and visualize comparisons to a baseline slice. You can evaluate pipelines of all sizes, and compare your results using different thresholds and confidence levels. Fairness Indicators allows you to deep-dive into individual slices and interrogate your dataset, adjusting confidence intervals and evaluations at multiple thresholds. \n",
        "\n",
        "Fairness Indicators is packaged with [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started) and [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) to allow users to evaluate the distribution of datasets and probe models down to the individual datapoint with the What-If Tool.\n",

      "source": [
        "The Civil Comments dataset comprises approximately 2 million public comments that were submitted to the [Civil Comments platform](https://medium.com/@aja_15265/saying-goodbye-to-civil-comments-41859d3a2b1d). [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) sponsored the effort to compile and annotate these comments for ongoing [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04561); they've also hosted competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) to help classify toxic comments as well as minimize unintended model bias. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the Civil Comments data, a subset of comments are tagged with a variety of identity attributes pertaining to gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, and ethnicity. Each identity annotation column contains a value that represents the percentage of annotators who categorized a comment as containing references to that identity. Multiple identities may be present in a comment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** These identity attributes are intended *for evaluation purposes only*, to assess how well a classifier trained solely on the comment text performs on different tag sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "To collect these identity labels, each comment was reviewed by up to 10 annotators, who were asked to indicate all identities that were mentioned in the comment. For example, annotators were posed the question: \"What genders are mentioned in the comment?\", and asked to choose all of the following categories that were applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Male\n",
        "* Female\n",
        "* Transgender\n",
        "* Other gender\n",
        "* No gender mentioned\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** *We recognize the limitations of the categories used in the original dataset, and acknowledge that these terms do not encompass the full range of vocabulary used in describing gender.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate score for each identity attribute representing the percentage of raters who said the identity was mentioned in the comment. For example, if 10 annotators reviewed a comment, and 6 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"female\" and 0 said that the comment mentioned the identity \"male,\" the comment would receive a `female` score of `0.6` and a `male` score of `0.0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** For the purposes of annotation, a comment was considered to \"mention\" gender if it contained a comment about gender issues (e.g., a discussion about feminism, wage gap between men and women, transgender rights, etc.), gendered language, or gendered insults. Use of \"he,\" \"she,\" or gendered names (e.g., Donald, Margaret) did not require a gender label. \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Label\n",
        "\n",
        "Each comment was rated by up to 10 annotators for toxicity, who each classified it with one of the following ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Very Toxic\n",
        "* Toxic\n",
        "* Hard to Say\n",
        "* Not Toxic\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, Jigsaw used these ratings to generate an aggregate toxicity \"score\" for each comment (ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`) to serve as the [label](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary?utm_source=Colab&utm_medium=fi-colab&utm_campaign=fi-practicum&utm_content=glossary&utm_term=label#label), representing the fraction of annotators who labeled the comment either \"Very Toxic\" or \"Toxic.\" For example, if 10 annotators rated a comment, and 3 of them labeled it \"Very Toxic\" and 5 of them labeled it \"Toxic\", the comment would receive a toxicity score of `0.8`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** For more information on the Civil Comments labeling schema, see the [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) section of the Jigsaw Untended Bias in Toxicity Classification Kaggle competition.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the feature values for one example in the dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`comment_text`**: `i'm a white woman in my late 60's and believe me, they are not too crazy about me either!!`\n",
        "* **`female`**: `1.0`\n",
        "* **`white`**: `1.0`\n",
        "\n",
        "All raters tagged this comment with the labels `female` and `white`, giving the example scores of `1.0` for each of these identity mention labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** All other identity labels (e.g., `male`, `asian`) had values of `0.0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the label for this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`toxicity`**: `0.0`\n",
        "\n",
        "All raters labeled the above comment \"not toxic,\" which resulted in a toxicity label of `0.0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing the data\n",
        "For the purposes of this exercise, we converted toxicity and identity columns to booleans in order to work with our neural net and metrics calculations. In the preprocessed dataset, we considered any value ≥ 0.5 as True (i.e., a comment is considered toxic if 50% or more crowd raters labeled it as toxic).\n",
        "\n",
        "For identity labels, the threshold 0.5 was chosen and the identities were grouped together by their categories. For example, if one comment has `{ male: 0.3, female: 1.0, transgender: 0.0, heterosexual: 0.8, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian: 1.0 }`, after processing, the data will be `{ gender: [female], sexual_orientation: [heterosexual, homosexual_gay_or_lesbian] }`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** Missing identity fields were converted to False.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example\n",
        "\n",
        "After preprocessing, here's the revised feature and label data for the example from above:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`comment_text`**: `i'm a white woman in my late 60's and believe me, they are not too crazy about me either!!`\n",
        "* **`gender`**: `[female]`\n",
        "* **`race`**: `[white]`\n",
        "* **`disability`**: `[]`\n",
        "* **`religion`**: `[]`\n",
        "* **`sexual_orientation`**: `[]`\n",
