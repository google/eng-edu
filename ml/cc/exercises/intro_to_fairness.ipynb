        "\n",
        "A key tool for comparing the prevalence of different types of model errors is a *confusion matrix*. Recall from the [Classification module of Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/true-false-positive-negative) that a confusion matrix is a grid that plots predictions vs. ground truth for your model, and tabulates statistics summarizing how often your model made the correct prediction and how often it made the wrong prediction. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by creating a binary confusion matrix for our income-prediction model—binary because our label (`income_bracket`) has only two possible values (`<50K` or `>50K`). We'll define an income of `>50K` as our **positive label**, and an income of `<50k` as our **negative label**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** *Positive* and *negative* in this context should not be interpreted as value judgments (we are not suggesting that someone who earns more than 50k a year is a better person than someone who earns less than 50k). They are just standard terms used to distinguish between the two possible predictions the model can make.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cases where the model makes the correct prediction (the prediction matches the ground truth) are classified as **true**, and cases where the model makes the wrong prediction are classified as **false**.\n",

        "* **false negative**: Model predicts `<50K`, and that contradicts reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** If desired, we can use the number of outcomes in each of these states to calculate secondary evaluation metrics, such as [precision and recall](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall)."
