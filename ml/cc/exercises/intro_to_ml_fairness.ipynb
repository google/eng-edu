Recall from the [Classification module of Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/true-false-positive-negative) that a confusion matrix is a grid that plots predictions vs. ground truth for your model, and tabulates statistics summarizing how often your model made the correct prediction and how often it made the wrong prediction. \n",
